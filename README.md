sample code to implement a simple bubble sort, just for fun
Basic bubble sort isn't that imporessive for performance, but its a classic

Idea is to take an unsorted array of numbers...
Compare the 1st elemnt to the 2nd.  If its larger, swap the 1st and 2nd elemnts around
Compare the 2nd and 3rd elements, if the 2nd > 3rd, swap them around
etc, etc  until teh largest elemnt has been bubbled to the end of the array
Then start again... until all the elements have been sorted
Its quite brute force, but does the job
